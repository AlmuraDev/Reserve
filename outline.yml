Reserve Specifications.

- Requires Java 7 due to Java NIO architecture to handle files (a lot better than Java 6 and below).
- Banks are stored in a folder called banks. Ex. /plugins/Reserve/banks
- Banks are stored relative to the world they were made in. Ex. /plugins/Reserve/banks/world or /plugins/Reserve/banks/world_nether
- The actual yaml file for a Bank is stored based on the bank's name. This makes a Bank's name a valuable commodity per world. Ex. /plugins/Reserve/banks/world/mybank.yml
- The construct of the yaml file is as follows:

general:
    holder: ninjazidane
accounts:
    ninjazidane:
        checking:
            balance: 20
        savings:
            balance: 28739
    gregabyte:
        checking:
            balance: -20
        savings:
            balance: 100		
        mutual:
            balance: 100000

- Each time a file is saved, it is wiped and re-made. This is done purely to make future upgrades to Banks 100% compatible with older systems.
- Files are not saved on transaction but on a schedule (every 2 mins). This may change to on transaction in the future.
- Reserve incorporates a "dirty" system. Essentially when an update is made, the bank is marked as dirty and in-need for an update. This keeps file changes to a minimum.
